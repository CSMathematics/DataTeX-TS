# Quick Start

Once you have DataTex running, here is how to get started.

## 1. Explore the Workspace

The main interface resembles a modern code editor:

- **Sidebar**: Manage your Database Collections and Files.
- **Editor Area**: The central place for writing LaTeX code.
- **Panels**: Access the PDF Viewer, Package Gallery, and more.

## 2. Create Your First Collection

DataTex uses a **Database-first** approach. You don't just "open files"; you organize them into Collections.

1.  Go to the Sidebar.
2.  Click **Create Collection** (or "Import Library").
3.  Give it a name (e.g., "Calculus 101").
4.  This collection will now house your exercises, definitions, and theorems.

## 3. Use a Wizard

Don't struggle with table syntax!

1.  Open a LaTeX file in the editor.
2.  Click the **Table Wizard** icon in the toolbar.
3.  Design your table visually using the grid.
4.  Click **Insert** to generate the LaTeX code automatically.

## 4. Compile a PDF

1.  Make sure you have a `\documentclass` defined (or use a Template).
2.  Press the **Build** button (or shortcut `Ctrl+B`).
3.  The built-in PDF viewer will update to show your result.
